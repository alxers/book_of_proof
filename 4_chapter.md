Part II
Chapter 4

Definition 4.3 Two integers have the same parity if they are both even or they are both odd. Otherwise they have opposite parity

Definition 4.4 Suppose a and b are integers. We say that a divides b, written a | b, if b = ac for some c in Z. In this case we also say that a is a divisor of b, and that b is a multiple of a.

4.3 Direct Proof
(proposition is a statement that, although true, is not as significant as a theorem.)

Suppose we have:
Proposition If P, then Q.

The goal is to show that this statement is true.
1. When P is false, P => Q is always true, so we don't have to worry about this case.
2. When P is true we must show that Q is also true



*Outline of Direct Proof*
Proposition If P, then Q.

Proof. Suppose P.
...
Therefore Q.

Exercises for Chapter 4
Use the method of direct proof to prove the following statements.
1. If x is an even integer, then x^2 is even.
