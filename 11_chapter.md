Relations

Definition 11.1 A relation on a set A is a subset R set_in A x A. Abbreviated as (x, y) in R as xRy.     

Example 11.1 Let A = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }.     
R = { (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1) } set_in A x A.     
1R1, 2R1, ... etc.     
R is greater-then-or-equal set.     


Exercises for Section 11.1.     
1. Let A = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }. Write out the relation R that express > on A.     
R = {     
    (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0),     
    (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1),     
    (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2),          
    (4, 3), (5, 3),               
    (5, 4),                    
}
